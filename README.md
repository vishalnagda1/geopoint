- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- üéØ **Customer Focus**: Click on customer in the list to focus on their location
- üßπ **Data Management**: Clear stored data and start fresh
- ‚úÖ **Data Validation**: Validates CSV columns and coordinate data
- ‚ö° **Batch Processing**: Handles large datasets (45,000+ records) efficiently
- üìà **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicator during data processing

## Required CSV Columns

Your CSV file must contain these columns (case-insensitive):
- `accno` - Account number
- `name` - Customer name
- `longitude` - Longitude coordinate
- `lattitude` - Latitude coordinate (note: can be "latitude" too)

Optional columns that will be displayed:
- `tariffcode` - Tariff code
- `kworhp` - KW or HP information
- `consumerstatus` - Consumer status
- `phase` - Phase information
- `meterno` - Meter number
- `consumption` - Consumption data
- `rdngmonth` - Reading month

## How to Use

1. **First Visit**: Upload your CSV file using the upload button
2. **Data Validation**: The app validates your data and shows any errors
3. **Batch Processing**: Large datasets are processed in batches with progress indicator
4. **Map View**: Successfully uploaded data is displayed on the map
5. **Navigation**: Use the burger menu to:
   - View list of all customers (first 100 shown for performance)
   - Click on any customer to focus on their location
   - Clear stored data
6. **Future Visits**: Data is automatically loaded from local storage

## Performance Features

- **Batch Processing**: Processes large CSV files (45,000+ records) in chunks
- **Progressive Loading**: Shows progress during data processing
- **Memory Management**: Optimizes localStorage usage for large datasets
- **Efficient Rendering**: Adds map markers in batches to prevent browser freezing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Missing required columns" error**: 
   - Ensure your Excel has columns named accno, name, longitude, lattitude
   - Column names are case-insensitive

2. **"No valid customer data found"**:
   - Check that longitude values are between -180 and 180
   - Check that latitude values are between -90 and 90
   - Ensure coordinate cells contain valid numbers

3. **Map not displaying**:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Ensure you have internet connection (for map tiles)
   - Try refreshing the page

4. **File upload not working**:
   - Ensure file is .csv format
   - Check file isn't corrupted
   - Verify CSV has proper comma separation

5. **Performance issues with large files**:
   - The app processes data in batches automatically
   - Large datasets may take a few minutes to process
   - Check the progress bar during processing
